1.What are the data types in python?explain
Ans.integer:Positive or negative whole numbers 
            Are the integer data types 
    Float:Any real number with a floating point
        Represents in which a fractional component
         Is denoted by a decimal symbol or
         Sytific notation
   Complexnumber:A number with a real and 
               Imaginary component represented 
                As x+y; x and y are floats and
                J=-1
   Boolen:Data with one of the two built in values
          True or false are not valid boolens 
          And python will thrown an error for them
  String:A string value is a collection of one
         Or more charecters put in single, double
         Triple quotes
  List:A list object is an ordered collection of
      One or more data items not necessarily of
      the same type put in square brackets
  Triple:A tripled object is an ordered collection 
         Of one or more  data items not necessary
         Of the same types put in brackets.


2.Briefly explain the history of python?
Ans.Python was created by Guido van rossum in
    1980 to 1990.He was a member of the national 
    Research institute it was designed as a 
    Response to the ABC programmer language was
    that python had expectation handling and was
    targeted for the ameoba operating system the
    name python is named from the British TV 
    Show monthly python in addiction to 
    exception handling python included classes
    lists and strings.


3.Explain the operators in python?
Ans.operators in python are:
▪︎Arithmetic operator:addition,subtraction,
                      multiplication,division
                      modulus exponation
▪︎Relational operator:<,>,<=,>=,==
▪︎Assignment operator:+=,-=,/=,**=,//=
▪︎Logical operator:and,or,not
▪︎Membership operator:in,noting
▪︎Identity operator:is,isn't
▪︎Bitwise operator:Binary and(&),Binary XOR(A),
                   ~,<<,>>


4.Explain features of python?
Ans.•Easy to code
    •Free and open source
    •Object oriented language
    •High level language
    •Extensible feature
    •Python is portable language
    •Python is integrated language
    •Large standered library 
    •Dynamically typed language


5.Justify why python is interpreted language?
Ans.unlike C\C++ etc.., python is an interpreted
    object oriented programming language the
    compiler translates the whole code in one-go
    rather than line by line this is the reason 
    why in c language all the errors are listed
    during compilation only.
